# DSA Daily Practice

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! 🎯
This is my daily log of problems and solutions to build strong fundamentals and problem‑solving skills.



## About

This repository is my personal learning hub for DSA, featuring:
- 🗓️ Daily problem solving to sharpen algorithmic thinking
- 💻 Hands‑on coding in C++ (primarily)
- 📈 Progress tracking and consistency
- 🏆 Problems from platforms like LeetCode and classic interview sheets

## Repository Structure

- `DSA_Learning/` – Topic‑wise notes and implementations
	- `array/`, `Basics/`, `day/`, `Dynamic_allocation/`, `Linked_List/`, `Mergesort/`, `pointer/`, `Queues/`, `Quick sort/`, `Recursion/`, `slidingwindow/`, `sorting/`, `Stack/`, `StL-library/`
- `leetcode/` – LeetCode problem solutions (single‑file C++ programs)
- `OOPS/` – Object‑Oriented Programming examples (constructors, destructors, pillars of OOP, etc.)
- `Practice/` – Additional practice and experiments
- `problem/` – Miscellaneous problems (recursion/backtracking/number theory, etc.)
- `build/` – Local build outputs (e.g., Debug). Safe to recreate if missing.

## Quick Start (Windows + VS Code)

Prerequisites:
- g++ (MSYS2/MinGW‑w64 or similar) with C++17 support
- VS Code with the Microsoft C/C++ extension

Build and run a single file (two easy options):

1) Using VS Code task
- Open any `.cpp` file and press `Ctrl+Shift+B`
- Choose: “C/C++: g++.exe build active file”
- Run the generated `.exe` from the same folder

2) Using terminal

```powershell
# Example: build and run a specific source
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -g "DSA_Learning/array/Kadane's Algorithm.cpp" -o build/Debug/kadane.exe
.\u200bbuild\Debug\kadane.exe
```

Notes:
- Paths containing spaces or quotes should be wrapped in quotes, as above.
- Most solutions read from standard input and write to standard output.
